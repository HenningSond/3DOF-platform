------------------------------------------------------ MPC setup

It is recomended to generate the MPC_code folder on every new computer. This is done by running the C_CodeGenerator.ipynb located in the MPC_generator folder. This code should be run in jupyter notebook. It is possible to change the name of the generated MPC folder name by changing the "code_dir='MPC_code'" on line 59 in C_CodeGenerator.ipynb.
This folder will be created in the MPC_generator folder, after it is created move it to the Main folder. 
If it is created with a different name the import and open calls in the MPC.py code on line 7, 9, 21 and 24 needs to be changed to the coresponding folder name.


------------------------------------------------------ Start

The application needs to be started from the Main directory.
To start the application start The Main.py code with python 3.8 or higher.

The arduino Uart/serial port may need to be changed. This can be changed in the Main.py code on line 264 or 267 dependent on the system.
